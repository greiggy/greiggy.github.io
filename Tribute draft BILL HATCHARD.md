 # Bill Hatchard Tribute
   
   Bill was born in Ross-on-Wye on August 24, 1927, to Frederick and Jane Hatchard. He had two older brothers, who sadly died during childhood, leaving Bill as an only child. Fred owned Archenfield Bakery and as Bill grew up he used to deliver bread on his bike, a job he thoroughly enjoyed. But he never wanted to follow his father into becoming a baker!

His mother Jane was a cook at Pengethly Manor and Bill often reminisced about how wonderful her cooking was. Next door was a family with 11 daughters and Bill would often joke about all the washing on the line!   Bill had a very happy childhood.

He spent summer days playing by the river with his friends, and he enjoyed watching the cricket in Ross. He was quite involved with St Mary's Church in his youth and somewhere there his name is carved in one of the church pews! He also loved school and used to speak fondly of his first teacher, Miss Phipps.

When Bill left school he joined the army and spent two years in India, a country that he loved. He would always tell people how friendly the people were and how beautiful the Taj Mahal was. For Bill the only downside was the food – he wasn't a fan of curry and much preferred egg and chips.

When Bill returned home, he had various jobs. Two of his favourites were working in a doughnut factory, and then at William Bevan funeral directors in Ross. Bill then started working at Thorn Lighting in Rotherwas and stayed there for many years.

Bill used to cycle from Ross to Hereford to see Beryl, and they got married in 1965 and shared a lovely daughter called Sue. As often happens, they were opposites in temperament – Beryl was quite a perfectionist while Bill was easy going and a peacemaker. At times marriage was a bumpy ride, but they sorted it out and got on. They lived in Belmont in those days, Ethelstan Crescent and then Kingfisher Road.Bill was a wonderful father to Sue, never raising his voice or his hand to her and he was always kind and caring and he loved her dearly. He was always playing with Sue, and he let her put makeup on him and rollers in his hair. He also taught her how to play cards and defended her in any trouble she managed to get into – she couldn't have wished for a better dad. When Sue was old enough, Bill managed to get her a job at Thorns working with him.

When Bill retired from Thorns he worked at Marks and Spencer and at Primark as a cleaner, and he was very well liked by all. During his time cleaning at M&S he once managed to knock over a display stand of ladies' knickers, and he was terribly embarrassed and tried to steer clear of that area from then on!

Bill had two grandchildren, Andrew and Samantha, and he turned out to be a very hands-on grandfather and devoted a huge amount of time to them. He loved making up stories about 'Red Fox' and would stay up with the children for hours reciting them. He was also keen on playing board games and Monopoly was his favourite.

He enjoyed walking the grandchildren down to the river to see George the horse and loved picking them up from school. During school holidays he would take them to market with Beryl and Sue. In later life, he became a great-grandparent to Samantha's Finlay and Holly,  and Andrew's Gabriel and Ezra.

Bill was an exceptionally kind person. His smile would light a room and he never had a bad word to say about anyone. He loved Beryl (who passed away ljust six months ago) and all his family and was so grateful for all the years that Sue cared for him. He used to say how wonderful she smelt and she would laugh and say it was the smell of egg and bacon from work!

Bill liked jazz music and Acker Bilk and by some he was better known by his nickname, 'Acker'. He also liked dancing and when there were wider family get-togethers in Chepstow or Bream he would be out on the floor after a few drinks! Some of his favourite things in life included Kit-Kats; watching old TV programmes like Dad's Army, Fawlty Towers and 'Allo 'Allo; daffodils; birds – Bill even fed to seagulls!; Arsenal Football Club; Morrison's; cups of tea; hot water bottles; his little clock – and bacon and egg sandwiches.Bill loved his life and all he wanted in life was for others to be as happy as he was.

He would want to express a huge thank you to people who supported him and cared for him over the years – Carl and Judy, Mary, a neighbour, who was an important part of Bill's later life and whose company he enjoyed – he used to say "Mary is marvellous" – and next door neighbour Pam for spending time with him more recently.

He will be greatly missed because He was a lovely person who gave so much – to family of all generations, and to friends and neighbours.
