### More Information

I work under the authority of the Bishop of Hereford and Team Rector of Weobley & Stanton benefice, with a specific brief to pioneer what has not been done before, and to work across the Christian denominations. Weobley has three church congregations, St Thomas RC, St Peter and St Paul C of E and Weobley Chapel, Methodist.

I am a community pastor 'outside the church walls' for attenders of each of these and especially for people who want to explore Christian faith but do not have a connection with a particular church.
